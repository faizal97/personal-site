A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes TruTrip's travel booking functionality to Claude Code, enabling AI-assisted travel management directly from the terminal.

Built with the MCP SDK and running on Bun, this server provides tools and resources that let Claude Code interact with TruTrip's booking system through structured, type-safe interfaces.

Key features:
- **MCP Tools**: Exposed endpoints for searching flights/hotels, retrieving booking details, and managing travel itineraries
- **MCP Resources**: Read-only access to user profiles, trip summaries, and travel policies
- **Zod Schemas**: Strict input validation and type-safe responses for all tool calls
- **Claude Code Integration**: Configured via MCP settings for seamless terminal workflows
- **Bun Runtime**: Fast startup and efficient execution for responsive AI interactions
