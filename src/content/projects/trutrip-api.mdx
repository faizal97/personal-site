Built and maintained the core REST API powering TruTrip's travel booking platform. The system handles real-time inventory from multiple suppliers, processes multi-currency transactions, and serves thousands of daily API requests.

Key contributions:
- Designed RESTful API architecture supporting flight, hotel, and ground transport bookings
- Implemented Redis caching layer reducing API response times by 60%
- Built COVID-19 case tracking system (CEC) for global pandemic data monitoring
- Integrated multiple third-party travel supplier APIs with unified response format
- Managed database optimization and query performance tuning
