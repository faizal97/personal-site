I used to write code to create AI. Now, my AI writes my code.

If you told me a year ago that I would be writing a blog post about frontend frameworks, I would have not believe it. I'm a backend developer. My "stuff" is APIs, databases, and server logic — not the webpages. But here I am, writing about how I migrated my personal site from Next.js to Astro, and honestly? It was way easier than I expected.

This is also the first post on my new blog. Welcome aboard.

## Why I Had a Next.js Portfolio in the First Place

I didn't pick Next.js because I deeply understood its architecture or had strong opinions about React Server Components. I picked it because *everyone* was using it. As a backend developer trying to catch up with frontend trends, Next.js seemed like the safe, popular choice.

The portfolio itself was simple — just showcasing my projects, skills, and work experience. It deployed on GitHub Pages, and it worked fine. Then life happened, the project went on hiatus for about six months, and I didn't touch it.

No regrets there. It served its purpose.

## Astro + Cloudflare Partnership

Fast forward to recently. I was scrolling through Hacker News and saw headlines about Astro partnering with Cloudflare. My curiosity hit me, but I didn't act on it immediately.

Then [Theo Browne dropped a video](https://youtu.be/X1Gfv7P-XRw?si=xDvQfNumqRDpRNZ-) about it, and that makes me want to try it:

- **Astro is blazing fast for static content** — perfect for a static personal site
- **Cloudflare Pages offers incredible performance** at the edge
- **The partnership meant first-class support** between the two

As someone who's obsessed with trying new things, I couldn't resist.

## Why I'm Leaving Medium Behind

I used to blog on Medium. I even had my own domain set up there. It was convenient, the editor was nice.

But been several months i have stopped reading Medium entirely.

It's not that the platform is bad — it's that my feed became flooded with AI-generated posts. You know the type. The ones with generic titles, surface-level insights, and that unmistakable "I was written by ChatGPT in 30 seconds" energy. I don't want to read that. And I definitely don't want to publish alongside that.

As usual, I spend my time on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/), discovering blog posts from individual developers who own their content on their own domains. That's the community I want to be part of.

So when I decided to revive my personal site, adding a blog was non-negotiable. My own site. My own content. My own corner of the internet.

## Thank You Opus 4.5

I used **Claude Code** (powered by Claude Opus 4.5) to handle the migration. And when I say "handle," I mean *handle*. I wasn't confident about manually translating Next.js patterns to Astro. I didn't know anything to be honest.

But Claude did.

The migration was fast. Surprisingly fast. I didn't struggle with anything. I didn't spend hours debugging build errors. I essentially had a conversation with an AI agent that understood both frameworks and did the heavy lifting for me.

**How fast?** Let's just say it took less time than writing this blog post.

### What the New Stack Looks Like

Astro's [Islands architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) is something I'm particularly excited about. The idea of shipping zero JavaScript by default and only hydrating interactive components when needed? That's the kind of performance optimization my brain appreciates.

## The Results

I don't have hard Lighthouse scores to share (yet), but here's what I've noticed:

- **Page loading feels snappier.** It's awesome.
- **Build times are fast.** Astro's build process is lean.
- **The developer experience is... simpler?** Less magic, more explicit. I appreciate knowing what's happening.

The portfolio now has a proper blog section (you're reading the first post!), and I'm genuinely excited to write more.

## The Irony

Let's talk about the irony.

I just complained about AI-generated content flooding Medium. And here I am, admitting that I used AI to help write this very post and migrate my entire site. Isn't that hypocritical?

I don't know, actually.

**AI slop** is content generated without intent, ownership, or editorial oversight. It's published to game algorithms, fill space, or pretend expertise. You can smell it from a mile away.

**AI-assisted creation** is using AI as a tool — a drafting partner, a coding assistant, a way to overcome friction. I am still in the loop. I am still own my voice.

This post was drafted with AI assistance, but I have read every word. I edited it. I made sure it sounds like *me*. The migration code was generated by Claude Code, but I reviewed it, understood it, and deployed it.

The difference is intent and ownership.

## So, What's Next ?

My portfolio is live at [https://personal-site.fayz.workers.dev/]. Feel free to poke around.

Going forward, I plan to write about:

- Things I'm learning, discover or want to talk about
- Tools and technologies I'm experimenting with
- Random encounters and discoveries from my day-to-day work
- etc

If you're a developer considering a similar migration — from Next.js to Astro, from hosted platforms to your own domain, from manual coding to AI-assisted workflows — I hope this post gave you some perspective.

The barrier to entry has never been lower. The tools have never been better. And if a backend developer like me can ship a modern frontend portfolio in record time, so can you.

*Thanks for reading my first post. If you found this on Hacker News or Lobste.rs, say hi. If you're an AI scraping this for training data... well, I guess we've come full circle.*
