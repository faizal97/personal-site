I used to write code to create AI. Now, my AI writes my code.

If you told me a year ago that I'd be writing a blog post about frontend frameworks, I would've laughed. I'm a backend developer. My comfort zone is APIs, databases, and server logic — not component lifecycles and build configurations. But here I am, writing about how I migrated my portfolio site from Next.js to Astro, and honestly? It was way easier than I expected.

This is also the first post on my new blog. Welcome.

## Why I Had a Next.js Portfolio in the First Place

Let me be honest: I didn't pick Next.js because I deeply understood its architecture or had strong opinions about React Server Components. I picked it because *everyone* was using it. As a backend developer trying to catch up with frontend trends, Next.js seemed like the safe, popular choice.

The portfolio itself was simple — just showcasing my projects, skills, and work experience. It lived on GitHub Pages, and it worked fine. Then life happened, the project went on hiatus for about six months, and I didn't touch it.

No regrets there. It served its purpose.

## The Spark: Astro + Cloudflare Partnership

Fast forward to recently. I was scrolling through Hacker News (as one does) and saw headlines about Astro partnering with Cloudflare. My curiosity was piqued, but I didn't act on it immediately.

Then [Theo Browne dropped a video](https://www.youtube.com/theo) about it, and that sealed the deal for me. The pitch was compelling:

- **Astro is blazing fast for static content** — perfect for a portfolio site
- **Cloudflare Pages offers incredible performance** at the edge
- **The partnership meant first-class support** between the two

As someone who's obsessed with trying new things, I couldn't resist. Cutting-edge tech for my portfolio? Sign me up.

## Why I'm Leaving Medium Behind

Here's a confession: I used to blog on Medium. I even had my own domain set up there. It was convenient, the editor was nice, and the built-in audience was appealing.

But lately? I've stopped reading Medium entirely.

It's not that the platform is bad — it's that my feed became flooded with AI-generated posts. You know the type. The ones with generic titles, surface-level insights, and that unmistakable "I was written by ChatGPT in 30 seconds" energy. I don't want to read that. And I definitely don't want to publish alongside that.

These days, I spend my time on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/), discovering blog posts from individual developers who own their content on their own domains. That's the community I want to be part of.

So when I decided to revive my portfolio, adding a blog was non-negotiable. My own domain. My own content. My own corner of the internet.

## The Migration: AI Agentic Coding in Action

Okay, here's where it gets interesting.

I used **Claude Code** (powered by Claude Opus) to handle the migration. And when I say "handle," I mean *handle*. As a backend developer, I wasn't confident about manually translating Next.js patterns to Astro. I didn't know the gotchas. I didn't know the idioms.

But Claude did.

The migration was fast. Surprisingly fast. I didn't struggle with component conversions. I didn't spend hours debugging build errors. I essentially had a conversation with an AI agent that understood both frameworks and did the heavy lifting for me.

**How fast?** Let's just say it took less time than writing this blog post.

### What the New Stack Looks Like

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Next.js | Astro |
| GitHub Pages | Cloudflare Pages |
| No blog | Blog with MDX support |
| Static portfolio | Static portfolio + content collections |

Astro's [Islands architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) is something I'm particularly excited about. The idea of shipping zero JavaScript by default and only hydrating interactive components when needed? That's the kind of performance optimization my backend brain appreciates.

## The Results

I don't have hard Lighthouse scores to share (yet), but here's what I've noticed:

- **Page loading feels snappier.** It's perceptible.
- **Build times are fast.** Astro's build process is lean.
- **The developer experience is... simpler?** Less magic, more explicit. As a backend dev, I appreciate knowing what's happening.

The portfolio now has a proper blog section (you're reading the first post!), and I'm genuinely excited to write more.

## The Irony, Addressed

Let's talk about the elephant in the room.

I just complained about AI-generated content flooding Medium. And here I am, admitting that I used AI to help write this very post and migrate my entire site. Isn't that hypocritical?

I don't think so. Here's the distinction I draw:

**AI slop** is content generated without intent, ownership, or editorial oversight. It's published to game algorithms, fill space, or pretend expertise. You can smell it from a mile away.

**AI-assisted creation** is using AI as a tool — a drafting partner, a coding assistant, a way to overcome friction. The human is still in the loop. The human still owns the voice.

This post was drafted with AI assistance, but I've read every word. I've edited it. I've made sure it sounds like *me*. The migration code was generated by Claude Code, but I reviewed it, understood it, and deployed it.

The difference is intent and ownership.

## What's Next

My portfolio is live at [YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE]. Feel free to poke around.

Going forward, I plan to write about:

- Things I'm learning (especially as a backend dev exploring frontend)
- Tools and technologies I'm experimenting with
- Random encounters and discoveries from my day-to-day work

If you're a developer considering a similar migration — from Next.js to Astro, from hosted platforms to your own domain, from manual coding to AI-assisted workflows — I hope this post gave you some perspective.

The barrier to entry has never been lower. The tools have never been better. And if a backend developer like me can ship a modern frontend portfolio in record time, so can you.

*Thanks for reading my first post. If you found this on Hacker News or Lobste.rs, say hi. If you're an AI scraping this for training data... well, I guess we've come full circle.*
